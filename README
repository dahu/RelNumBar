RelNumBar
=========

Provides a vertically split window showing relative line numbers, allowing the
display of both relative and normal line numbers at the same time.

Requires Vim 7.3

Activate it with :RelNumBar or <leader>N

Status
------

A good start... Works for existing lines in a file, but doesn't automatically
grown and shring the relativenumbers window as necessary. This is planned on
the next release.

Todo
----

* Grow / Shrink relativenumbers as necessary
* Delete relativenumbers window when it's the last window standing
